### mood_gem_horizons2020

This project was done in HackGT: Horizons 2020 @ Georgia Institute of Technology

## Inspiration
We often get too busy to care about ourselves and forget how valuable we are. Writing journals to keep track of one's mood and thoughts is great, but in busy days, it can be challenging to make the time for that. Mood Gem allows individuals to reflect on their day easily and express their day as a gem.

## What it does
At the end of each day, you take seven-question long mini survey, and as a result, you get a gem that describes how your day was. Along with the type of gem, users get a short explanation of the meaning of gem and some advice. You have a bi-weekly wooden board to put the gem of today, and once you fill all the blocks in the board with different gems, you will see how your last two weeks were.

## How we built it
We created a web app of questionnaires using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We drew gems on our own, and we utilized a laser cutter in order to make the wooden board and wooden figures of gems.
